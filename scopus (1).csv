In recent years, this human-pathogenic parasite has led to several foodborne outbreaks in the United States and Canada, mostly associated with imported produce. Understanding the biology and epidemiology of C. cayetanensis is difficult because little is known about its origin, possible zoonotic reservoirs, and genetic relationships with other coccidian parasites. Recently, we developed a 70. kDa heat shock protein (HSP70) gene based nested PCR protocol for detection of C. cayetanensis parasite and sequenced the PCR products of 16 human isolates from Nepal, Mexico, and Peru. In this study, we have characterized the regions of 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene of 17 human C. cayetanensis isolates for molecular detection, and also to ascertain the genetic diversity of this parasite. The 18S rRNA primer sets were further tested by PCR amplification followed by nucleotide sequencing of the PCR amplified products of previously characterized C. cayetanensis isolates from three endemic regions at HSP70 locus. Although no genetic polymorphism was observed at the regions of HSP70 locus characterized in our previous study, the data analysis of this study revealed a minor genetic diversity at the 18S rRNA locus among the C. cayetanensis isolates. The 18S rRNA gene-based nested PCR protocol provides a useful genetic marker for the detection of C. cayetanensis parasite and confirms it as a genetically distinct species in genus Cyclospora. The results also supported lack of geographic segregation and existence of genetically homogeneous population for the C. cayetanensis parasites both at the HSP70 as well as at the 18S rRNA loci. © 2013.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84896739816"

The majority of Eimeria species have been, and still are, however, described on oocyst morphology alone. Four different oocysts with this basic morphology were encountered in the faeces of Brazilian tortoises, Geochelone carbonaria Spix, 1824 and are assigned to the genus Eimeria, with the view that they can readily be transferred to the genus Choleoeimeria or Acroeimeria if this is indicated by a future examination of their endogenous development. A morphological comparison distinguishes the oocysts from those of Eimeria spp., previously described in chelonids of the family Testudinidae, and the names E. amazonensis, E. carbonaria, E. carajasensis and E. wellcomei n. spp. are proposed. Coccidial infection appears to be common in G. carbonaria, with three of seven animals examined passing oocysts. Oocysts of lsospora rodriguesae n. sp. (Protozoa: Eimeriidae) are described in the faeces of Geochelone denticulata Linnaeus, 1766.

The name Cyclospora cayetanensis was introduced in 1992. The complete morphological description was published only in 1994. Cyclospora presents in faeces as spherical oocysts with a diameter of 8-10 μm. The cell wall is clearly delineated with a double membrane enveloping several round refractile granules. Cyclospora is distributed worldwide. Some outbreaks were described in the US, linked to consumption of raspberries from Guatemala, consumption of lettuce, and drinking of contaminated water. The parasite appears to be endemic in Nepal, Haiti, and Peru. In the period between January and June 1998, 15 Cyclospora infections were reported in Belgium, all of which were probably imported. The geographical origin of the infections was obtained for 10 patients: 5 patients had travelled to Indonesia, 3 to Turkey, 1 to Mexico, and 1 to Tibet. The Institute for Tropical Medicine in Antwerp registered in 1997 13 cases of Cyclospora infection. Most of these infections were contracted in Indonesia, Central America, Africa, and Turkey. Many laboratories were not aware of the new parasite. They needed to be informed and instructed about the clinical and diagnostic features of Cyclospora. Therefore a stool specimen with Cyclospora was included twice in the National External Quality Control scheme (January 1997 and 1998). The detection rate improved significantly, approximately by 30%, for the second scheme. In June 1998 the participants were invited to fill in a questionnaire about the detection of Cyclospora. The questionnaire revealed the following: half of the participants were unaware of the existence of Cyclospora before their participation to the External Quality Control scheme in January 1997. Approximately two thirds of the participants detected a Cyclospora oocyste for the first time in the sample during the first EQC round. Only half of the laboratories will routinely search for Cyclospora. In conclusion, to improve the detection capability of parasites by the laboratories and to ensure that Cyclospora will be detected even in routine samples further training is still needed.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0033502711"

We present reports on the seven cases and a review of the literature. Three patients were known to be seropositive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). All complained of watery diarrhea that had begun 3 days to 8 months before presentation. Colonoscopy in two patients showed a normal mucosal pattern; a biopsy for one of these patients showed chronic nonspecific inflammation of the colon. Examination of stool for ova and parasites revealed multiple oval and round nonrefractile organisms with well-defined walls that resembled large cryptosporidia; they measured 8–9 μmin diameter. These organisms did not stain by Giemsa or gram methods but were acid-fast by Kinyoun carbolfuchsin and Ziehl-Neelsen stains. The organisms fluoresced as blue under ultraviolet light. In the immunocompetent patients, diarrhea lasted an average of 19 days and resolved spontaneously. Diarrhea persisted in the HIV-seropositive patients.

Organisms with a similar appearance have been isolated from Peruvian patients since 1985. From 1988 to 1991 we studied prospectively two cohorts of infants and young children infected with this organism. We now attempt to identify it. Methods: Fecal samples were collected weekly from the children and examined with the use of acid-fast staining and staining with a monoclonal antibody specific for cryptosporidium. Stools positive for cyanobacterium-like bodies were preserved in potassium dichromate and exposed to conditions allowing coccidian sporulation and excystation. Both unsporulated and sporulated oocysts were fixed by freeze-substitution techniques and then examined by electron microscopy. Results: Organisms isolated from the feces of Peruvian patients and two patients from the United States were identified as belonging to the coccidian genus cyclospora, after sporulation and excystation of the oocysts according to standard techniques. Complete sporulation occurred within 5 to 13 days in oocysts maintained in potassium dichromate at 25 or 32 °C. Complete excystation resulted in the liberation of two sporozoites from the two sporocysts within each oocyst (cryptosporidia have four naked sporozoites within each oocyst). The presence of organelles characteristic of coccidian organisms was confirmed by electron microscopy. Conclusions: We have identified organisms of the genus cyclospora that are remarkably similar to cryptosporidia in their morphologic features and the diarrheal disease that they produce in humans. The complete life cycle and epidemiology of this new protozoan parasite remain to be described., Spherical organisms that are 8 to 10 micrometers in diameter and have variable characteristics on acid-fast staining are being identified with increasing frequency in feces from both immunocompetent visitors to developing countries and immunocompromised patients with chronic diarrhea in the United States1–8. The first reported cases of infection with such organisms attributed the illness to an unsporulated, coccidian body or a fungal spore1.

I used the direct faeces test and spontaneous sedimentation tube technique to detect cysts, ova, and larvae. To detect intestinal coccidia, I applied acid stain using the ZiehlNeelsen modified method. I detected parasites in 16 scats (57.1%), identifying 3 protozoa for the first time in the Andean bear: Blastocystis sp., Cryptosporidium sp., and Giardia sp.; as well as 3 nematodes: Strongyloides sp., an undetermined species of Ascarididae, and Ancylostomatidae. The greatest prevalence of parasites were of the family Strongyloididae (25.0%), followed by Ascarididae (21.4%), and Cryptosporidiidae (14.3%). Parasites were found in a greater percentage of scats collected during the dry season (87.5%) compared with the rainy season (16.7%). Overall, 8 species of endoparasites and 1 species of ectoparasite have been identified in Andean bears. © 2015 International Association for Bear Research and Management.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84931447839"

Cyclosporiasis is characterized by mild to severe nausea, anorexia, abdominal cramping, and watery diarrhea. Cyclospora has now been described from patients with protracted diarrheal illness in North, Central and South America, the Caribbean, Africa, Bangladesh, south-east Asia, Australia, England, and eastern Europe, and is characterized by marked seasonality. Routes of transmission are still unknown, although the fecal-oral route, either directly or via water, is probably the major one. A recent outbreak in the USA suggested transmission of Cyclospora by ingestion of contaminated berries. Cyclospora oocysts can be detected by phase contrast microscopy, modified acid-fast staining, autofluorescence, and amplification by the polymerase chain reaction. Oocysts are not sporulated when excreted in the feces, and sporulated oocysts are needed for infection. Each sporulated oocyst contains two sporocysts and each sporocyst contains two sporozoites. Humans seem to be the only host for this parasite. Histopathological examination of jejunal biopsies from infected individuals showed mild to moderate acute inflammation of the lamina propria and surface epithelial disarray. Parasitophorous vacuoles containing sexual and asexual forms of Cycl. cayetanensis were located in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells. Cyclospora infections can be treated succesfully with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0032471411"
